    <h2>Attack on Titan: The Plot is an Endless Cycle</h2>
    <p id="content">
        I have been thinking about the ending of the manga and I came up with a theory that, to me at least, seems really possible. The main thing that made me come to these ideas is the general philosophy of the manga so far. To me the two important ones would be the "eye for an eye" nature of humanity, and "history repeats itself". The examples for both of these can be seen in some of the most important events in the story. Paradis island being attacked by the warriors, countless people killed including Eren's mother - Eren himself attacking Liberio district and killing countless people in retribution. The Eldians enslaving and committing horrors towards the entire world with the use of titans - Marley enslaving Eldians and committing war crimes with the use of titans in retribution. There probably are more but I can only think of these two big ones. For this theory another big thing is Eren's goal of ending the titans and the way titan memories affected his mind. To finally jump to the theory itself, I think Eren will eat all of the nine titan shifters in an attempt to gain unlimited power and destroy both Marley for wronging Eldians, and Eldians themselves because they literally are potential titans. However each new titan form will flood his mind with memories that will haunt him, and send him spiraling further down into madness. Because of his broken mind he will get a twisted perception of the world seeing enemies all around, which will strengthen his desire to annihilate everyone. As a reflection of that his titan form will look more and more twisted and horrifying. The final step towards complete madness will be obtaining the Collosal titan, aka eating Armin. This will break both his mind and Mikasa's bond to him completely, turning the survey corps against him, who will all die by him. With all nine titans he will destroy almost everything, the only thing stopping him from infinite power would be his lack of royal blood. But here steps in another important figure - Ymir Fritz herself! Historia is pregnant, and my guess is she is carrying a girl who she will name Ymir after her dead friend/lover. This girl, who is pure of heart and mind will end up confronting Eren, who at this point has become the devil himself. Seeing her will bring him one final moment of sanity, and the realization of his actions will hit him then. In an attempt at redemption he makes a deal with little Ymir, giving her the nine titans which combined with her royal blood make her the most powerful being in the world. She reconstructs the world, and with her history truly repeats itself.
