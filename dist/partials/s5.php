    <h2>Dragon Ball Super: The TRUE Importance of Vegeta's New Powers</h2>
    <p id="content">
        While Vegeta's new technique in the latest DBS manga chapter was amazing, defeating Moro may not be what it's best suited for.The latest chapter of the Dragon Ball Super manga gave fans a pleasant surprise by finally revealing Vegeta's brand new powers -- spirit fission. While the display of his new technique was amazing, defeating Moro may not be what it's best suited forThe result of Vegeta's training on Planet Yardrat was nothing short of amazing as he returned to Earth stronger than ever -- and even more powerful than his longtime rival, Goku. As Vegeta forced Moro to spit out the life and spirit energy that he stole, it was revealed that the Saiyan Prince now has the ability to separate spirits and life energy from an individual. This is a technique that has never before been seen in Dragon Ball history -- the Spirit Bomb follows the same principles but it absorbs life energy and doesn't force it out of a host. Vegeta's new powers were so devastating to Moro that it caused him to revert to his old and decrepit original form.The Saiyan Prince's technique was so advanced that even Goku admitted that he was unable to successfully learn the technique during his time on Yardrat.Without giving so much attention to how Vegeta has physically raised his battle power -- the possibilities that have come forth from this his new ability are endless. This can be supported by one sentence that Vegeta spoke to Piccolo during their brief talk: "Yes, I could even extract those other Namekians you combined with ages ago." The most important takeaway from this conversation is not the part where Vegeta speaks about extracting Kami and Nail -- but the fact that he mentions "ages ago," meaning that regardless of how much time has passed, he can still separate them.
