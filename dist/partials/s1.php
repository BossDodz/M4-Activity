    <h2>One Punch Man: Blast is Connected to Saitama's Power</h2>
    <p id="content">
        If Blast represents the biggest unknown in One-Punch Man, the second question fans desperately want answered is the source of Saitama's monstrous power. One of the story's best recurring gags is Saitama's claim that he became strong by doing "100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and a 10km run every single day." Neither Saitama's friends or foes believe that such power could come from a workout so mundane (by superhero standards, at least) and while Genos continues to probe for the true source of his master's strength, exactly how the Caped Baldy went from directionless university graduate to the world's strongest fighter remains a mystery.
        While these two plot points may seem separate, there's a good chance Blast could hold some connection to Saitama's power. Firstly, Blast's continued absence in One-Punch Man season 2 is a strong indication that the character will have a significant impact on the series. The No. 1 ranked superhero has been built up as a source of intrigue and will surely offer something special to justify the aura of mystery around him.One strong possibility is that Blast and Saitama are related, most likely father and son, and there are several clues in the manga that hint towards this. In the original One-Punch Man web comic, Saitama and Blast are shown to have very similar personalities. Much like Saitama, a flashback sequence sees Blast describe fighting crime as a hobby, only turning up when it suits him or when humanity is truly in peril. Blast also offers Tatsumaki some direct, straight-forward advice in a manner very similar to Saitama's unintentionally inspirational teachings to Genos.It's perhaps also significant that One-Punch Man has revealed absolutely nothing about Saitama's origins or family and, given that Blast was active 18 years before the start of the series, the ages and dates would also line up. The brief image the One-Punch Man manga has provided of Blast shows him to be a regular human in a standard superhero outfit, similar in style and appearance to Saitama.
