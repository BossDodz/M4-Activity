    <h2>Mob Psycho 100: What Tsubomi Really Is</h2>
    <p id="content">
        Tsubomi has been the character that made Mob the way he is since he decided to better himself to impress her since his psychic powers were not enough. One thing I wonder is why Mob likes Tsubomi so much. He knew her ever since they were very young but he could have gotten over her after realizing that she was not interested in him and his psychic powers anymore. But instead he kept on having a crush on her and he says that he doesn't know why he likes her which is odd. It could be because she is popular or that she is pretty but based on what we know about Mob from the beginning is that he doesn't really understand the appeal of popularity and only seems to recently have seen what it's like to be popular. In the case of Tsubomi being pretty I am not sure that is a sufficient reason for Mob having a crush on her considering other guys have a crush on her because she is pretty which is an ideology Mob would not have since he typically thinks differently than most people around him.

        The reason why I bring all of this up is that it is strange for Mob to have a crush on Tsubomi based on what we know of his character. What I find extra strange is how a random car was able to hit Mob on the exact moment he was going to see Tsubomi which caused ???% to activate and how Tsubomi is confident that Mob is coming to talk to her even with everything that is happening in the city. Another thing I find strange is how based on what Dimple said in the Broccoli arc that Tsubomi could not be mind controlled as easily as everyone else. While sometimes Tsubomi may seem to be just a popular girl she also seems to be a little different from others from time to time. What I don't understand is why Mob stopped showing his powers to others after Tsubomi said that she was not impressed with them. The argument that Mob stopped showing his powers after he hurt Ritsu could also be made since Mob was younger when he did that but I think it started with Tsubomi's lack of interest in Mob's powers.

        My point based on all of this and other evidence is that Tsubomi is not a regular girl and that she is in fact an esper. I came to this conclusion from how she became uninterested in Mob's powers even though his powers are not just something normal that anyone can obtain. While him using his powers repeatedly could eventually be seen as boring all the other espers have seen their powers as incredible and some even considered themselves better than all other humans because they have powers. While Tsubomi could just think differently compared to others I think there is more to her than that. I think she has her own powers and I think she disregarded Mob's powers because she had stronger powers than him and she only saw an interest in his powers in the beginning because he was like her. She ended up "falling" for the guys who were athletic because they had physical strength instead of psychic strength which she excelled in.
